  A multiple refresh everytime to download common html codes/assets during interaction.
  which leads lots of request and data consumtption and not being smooth

Single Page Application:
  SPA, loads only the specific contents which needs changes and makes requests/assets call calls only for the specific region of the site

React Setup:

  what is react?
    front-end js library for manipulating DOM and producing contents using jsx

  1. npm create vite@latest
  2. enter project name
  3. select framework react
  4. select variant javascript
  5. Follow the instructions on the screen

  Structure of React & Folder Structure

  jsx --> javascript xml, which permitts to write html elements inside js file

  import/export

  Virtual DOM:
    Real DOM: Tree like structure 
      html 
        head
          title
          script
          icon
        body
          div
          h1
          a
          p

    Virtual DOM: is In Memory Copy of the real DOM used while manipulating the DOM.

    React  SPA:
    Virtual DOM
      The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.

    Advantage: reconciliation process

      where the changes happens only in the virtual DOM which will be compared with old virtual DOM. And if any difference is found it will affected in the Real DOM. 

      No changes, Only memory/Virtual DOM changes not the real DOM

  webpack & babeljs conversion

  components:
    Simple function returning JSX syntax combined to form a single component
      Eg:
        Card, Instagram Post, Menu Options
     can be used like a tag/element in jsx syntax
    
    Expressions/variables are put inside curly of jsx syntax
  
  props:
    attributes passed for a component is called as prop
    which can be used inside the props / destructured at component level

  className instead of class ( class is a keyword in js )
    class is a keyword for creating blueprints of user defined object
    because of which we need to use className instead of class jsx syntax
